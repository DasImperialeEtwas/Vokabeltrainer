# Vokabeltrainer
Simple Android app for learning new vocabulary.
You can easily import your own vocabulary by placing a csv file in the external storage or entering it using the built-in import function.
The vocabulary trainer is based on a simple principle:
  - a word is displayed
  - 4 answer options are displayed, only one is correct.
  - If you are right, the button turns green, if you are wrong, it turns red and the correct answer turns green.
  - After you click on the "next" button, a new word appears

Another nice feature is the visual feedback you get at the end of your practice run. You can see how many words you 
You can see how many words you have solved correctly and incorrectly and how many words you have practiced in total.
